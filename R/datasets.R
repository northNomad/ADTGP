#' Raw protein data from MissionBio's 2PBMC dataset
#'
#' A dataset containing raw counts of 45 proteins from 3,751 cells
#' (a mix of two PBMC samples).
#' Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument.
#' Protein reads were generated at 339x coverage of reads/antibody/cell.
#'
#' @format A matrix with 45 columns and 3,751 rows.
